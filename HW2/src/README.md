CPSC 435: Fall 2023
HW2: Rendering 3D Objects

Building and Running Instructions:
 1. Build following instructions in the 453VulkanStarter repository's README.md
    a. Choose [Release] when doing [CMake: Select Variant]
    b. Choose [HW2Starter] when doing [CMAKE: Build Target]
 2. Ensure build finished successfully
 3. Navigate to [build] where there should be a HW2Starter.exe
 4. Run HW1Starter.exe by doing [./HW2Starter.exe path/to/obj/file.obj]
    a. To avoid issues, please use absolute path to the obj file you intend to render
 5. Camera controls:
    a. Scroll to zoom camera
    b. Left click to rotate camera
    c. Right click to pan camera
 6. Extrinsic model rotations:
    a. Use [Q] and [W] keys for extrinsic x rotations
    b. Use [A] and [S] keys for extrinsic y rotations
    c. Use [Z] and [X] keys for extrinsic z rotations
 7. Intrinsic model rotations:
    a. Use [O] and [P] keys for intrinsic x rotations
    b. Use [K] and [L] keys for intrinsic y rotations
    c. Use [N] and [M] keys for intrinsic z rotations
 8. Model scaling:
    a. Use [Enter] for scaling up
    b. Use [Delete] for scaling down
 9. Light related constants are located in starter.frag if you wish to change any of them
